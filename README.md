Software Engineering Assigment 2017-2018 (Politecnico di Milano, Cremona)

The assigment required the realization of a JavaFX client application + Server to manage small schools and summer camps.
There were no requirements on security so everything in this project is to be considered unsafe, although it should be easy to add a session layer to the network module with encryption and authentication.
Time constraints have forced us to simplify some components and some additional work is needed to get a more flexible application.

Every comment and major parts of the code are in Italian as english was not required.
